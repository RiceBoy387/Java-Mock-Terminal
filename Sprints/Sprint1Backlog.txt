//Sprint 1 Backlog.
June 15 to June 21


User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:
a) as a user my input should be parsed through an interpreter
b) as a user the interpreter should determine the type of command I enter and execute appropriately
c) as a user I should be able to mkdir to make one or more directories all at once
d) as a user I should be able to use cd to change the current directory
e) as a user I should be able to use the ls command to list all the files in the current directory or a directory of my choice
f) as a user I should be able to use pwd to see the current working directory
g) as a user I should be able to use the pushd command to add a directory onto the directory stack so I can access it later


Specific tasks to be accomplished:
a-1. (CRC Cards) Update CRC cards
a-2. (JShell) Modify code from a1 to parse for new commands
a-3. (JShell) Add appropriate returns for incorrect parameters on new commands

c-5. (PathCheck) Implement ability to check if a given path already exists or not
c-6. (PathCheck) Implement ability to generate a full path given a relative path.
c-7. (Mkdir) Complete code to parse directory that must be made
c-8. (Mkdir) Make sure the directory to be made does not already exist, return stderr if it does
c-9. (Mkdir) Complete code to make the new directory
d-1. (Cd) Complete code to check if directory exists
d-2. (Cd) Change to the desired directory
e-1. (Ls) Write code to obtain list of files in the working directory

f-1. (Pwd) Write base code for Pwd class
f-2. (JShell) Update Pwd object on change of directory
f-3. (Pwd) Write code to print current working directory
g-1. (Stack) Add data type with stack functionality (LIFO)
g-2. (Pushd) Implement push of current working directory into stack
g-3. (Pushd) Implement change to user desired directory
