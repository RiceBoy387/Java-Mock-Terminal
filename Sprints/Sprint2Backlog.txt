//Sprint 2 Backlog.
June 22 to June 28


User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:
a) As the customer I should be able to use the pushd command to store the current working directory I'm in to a stack to be accessed later and change to a given directory
b) As the customer I should be able to use the popd command to access the most recent directory i pushed onto the directory stack	
c)As the customer I should be able to use the history command to see all the past commands I've executed and i should be able to specify how many items in history i want to see
d)As the customer I should be able to use the cat command to see the contents of one or more files
e)As the customer I should be able to use the echo command to either output a string to the standard output or be able to use '>' after the command to make a file with given string in it or i should be able to use '>>' after the command to append the string to the end of an existing file
f) As the customer I should be able to use mkdir to make one or more directories all at once
g)As the customer the interpreter should determine the type of command I enter and execute appropriately
